# DOLAN-Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases my data science projects, featuring code, analysis, and insights across various domains. Each project is organized into its own folder, containing relevant datasets, code, and other files.

## Repository Structure 📂 
**Projects:** Each folder represents a unique data science project, including its code, datasets (if applicable), and a README with a project overview.  

## Tidy Data Project 🧼

In this project, I clean and organize data by applying various functions to reshape and transform a dataset into a more structured format. I specifically work with data on medalists from the 2008 Summer Olympics, ensuring it is properly tidied before performing basic exploratory data analysis.

This project enhances my coding portfolio by showcasing my ability to clean, organize, and analyze real-world data. In particular, this project highlights skills I have been developing in class, like cleaning datasets and transforming raw data into a structured format for meaningful analysis. Furthermore, this project complements my work with other tools, such as Streamlit, by enhancing my ability to analyze data and create insightful visualizations.
