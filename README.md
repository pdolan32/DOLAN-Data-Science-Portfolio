# DOLAN-Data-Science-Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases my data science projects, featuring code, analysis, and insights across various domains. Each project is organized into its own folder, containing relevant datasets, code, and other files.

## Repository Structure üìÇ 
**Projects:** Each folder represents a unique data science project, including its code, datasets (if applicable), and a README with a project overview.  

## Machine Learning Application üìà
 **Link to the Machine Learning Application Repository:** Click [HERE](https://github.com/pdolan32/DOLAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/MLStreamlitApp) to access the project repository.

In this project, I created an interactive Streamlit application that provides users with an intuitive platform for exploring datasets and applying supervised machine learning models. Within the app, users can upload their own datasets or choose from built-in sample datasets and select from a range of supervised learning models for both regression and classification. Furthermore, users are able to define and customize target and feature variables and hyperparameters and visualize model performance with tools like confusion matrices, decision trees, and ROC curves. The process of building this app strengthened my understanding of machine learning by reinforcing core concepts like data preprocessing, model selection, and performance evaluation. Moverover, it also gave me a clearer grasp of the similarities and differences between various types of supervised learning models and how to apply them effectively.

This application enhances my overall portfolio by demonstrating my ability to build interactive Python tools and deploy machine learning models in a user-friendly format. While other projects in my portfolio also focus on data analysis and visualization, this app stands out by showcasing a full end-to-end workflow, from data input to model output, all within an intuitive Streamlit interface.

## Tidy Data Project üßº
 **Link to the Tidy Data Project Repository:** Click [HERE](https://github.com/pdolan32/DOLAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/TidyData-Project) to access the project repository.

In this project, I clean and organize data by applying various functions to reshape and transform a dataset into a more structured format. I specifically work with data on medalists from the 2008 Summer Olympics, ensuring it is properly tidied before performing basic exploratory data analysis.

This project enhances my coding portfolio by showcasing my ability to clean, organize, and analyze real-world data. In particular, this project highlights skills I have been developing in class, like cleaning datasets and transforming raw data into a structured format for meaningful analysis. Furthermore, this project complements my work with other tools, such as Streamlit, by enhancing my ability to analyze data and create insightful visualizations.

## Spotify Streams App üé∏ü•Åüé∂

**Link to the Tidy Data Project Repository:** Click [HERE](https://github.com/pdolan32/DOLAN-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/main/basic_streamlit_app) to access the project repository.

The Spotify Streams App is a simple Streamlit application that displays the top ten most-streamed songs on Spotify for February 6th, 2025. The app provides an interactive way to explore streaming data, allowing users to view key details about each song and customize their display preferences.
