### The Spotify Streams app is a basic streamlit app which showcases the top ten most-streamed songs on Spotify for February 6th, 2025. 

The displayed dataframe consists of information including each song's title, the names of the main and featured artists (if applicable), and each song's daily streams and total streams. The app has interactivity widgets to customize the data display: for instance, by using the buttons, the user can toggle between displaying each song's daily stream count or total stream count. Furthermore, there is a drop-down menu where the user can select an individual song to display the data for.

To open the app, run the following command in the VSCode Terminal: streamlit run basic_streamlit_app/spotify_streams_app.py
